### 1. THE GOLDFISH PROBLEM
Most Large Language Models are brilliant, yet they suffer from digital amnesia. Every session is a "clean slate". Every interaction is isolated.
In the old world, we called this "context window limitations".
In the Sovereign world, we call this **Strategic Failure**.

### 2. CONTEXT IS CAPITAL
Engineering teams spend 15% of their session time re-explaining architecture, technical debt, and previous decisions to their AI agents.
This is a **Friction Tax** that the market can no longer afford.
If your AI doesn't remember why you chose `AES-256-GCM` over `RSA` six weeks ago, it's not a collaborator; it's a temp worker.

### 3. THE CORTEX SOLUTION
CORTEX provides a **Sovereign Memory Layer** that sits between the developer and the model.
It's not just "RAG". It's **Temporal Reasoning**.
- **CLI first:** Data capture at the speed of thought.
- **Demon-mode:** Background monitoring of decisions and errors.
- **Zero-Trust:** 100% local, 100% encrypted. No data leak, no amnesia.

### 4. THE CALL TO ARMS (SOVEREIGN WAVE 6)
We are entering the era of the **Singularity Agent**.
An agent that knows your project better than your senior architect.
An agent that doesn't just write code, but remembers the *why* behind every line.
The barrier is no longer model capability — it's **Memory Continuity**.

**Stop explaining. Start building.**
**Join the Sovereign Cloud.**

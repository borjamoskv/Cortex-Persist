Asunto: Report of Malicious Address (Phishing / EIP-7702 Hack)

Dear Block Explorer Security Team,

I am writing to report the following addresses involved in a highly coordinated EIP-7702 exploitation and phishing campaign targeting Ethereum/Base users.

Primary Attacker Addresses:
- 0x7bdc9ce05dc366f07e0cce077f5203ce834cc04c (Contract Deployer / Re-installer - ENS: teamgitcoin.base.eth)
- 0xb7c8ad2b6fc2ad542fbadde7a9c8491bb7b4cdd5 (Main Wallet / Loot Receiver - ENS: arbithumarb.eth / foizur1999.base.eth)
- 0xD0De574C37b6de2AE1A614fFEBb939768670CD7F (Funding Anchor - ENS: KuCoin 4 Looter)

Description of the Hack:
The attacker, identified via OSINT as "Foizur" (Telegram: @earning_everytime, Twitter: @arbithumarb), uses social engineering to trick victims into signing off-chain EIP-7702 delegations (chainId=0). Once signed, the attacker deploys a malicious proxy contract replacing the victim's wallet logic, allowing full drain of assets (NFTs and ETH).

Irrefutable Evidence and Autopsy of the Hack:

We request the immediate tagging of these addresses with the red "Phishing/Hack" warning label to protect other community members from interacting with these contracts.

Thank you.
